## Core Features:

- QR Code Generation: Generate a static QR code for each employee that encodes a unique identifier.
- Status Display: Determine whether the employee is authorized to view the page or not, and display status (Authorized/Unauthorized).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light grey or white for a clean background.
- Secondary color: A corporate color (e.g., a shade of blue or green) for the header and key elements.
- Accent: Use a contrasting color (e.g., orange or red) to indicate unauthorized status.
- Clean and simple layout with clear sections for employee information and status.
- Use standard icons for employee details (name, position, etc.).
- Subtle transitions when the status changes (e.g., authorized to unauthorized).
